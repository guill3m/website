Everything on this website (text, images, code) is personally made by me, not using generative AI.

I believe AI and LLMs can be valuable tools and I occasionally use them for research and experimentation. However, this site and anything I publish under my name on social networks, other sites, or newsletters is purposely AI-free. I enjoy the creative process and I don’t want to offload this process to a machine.

If any of this changes in the future, I’ll update this page to reflect it.
