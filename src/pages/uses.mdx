## Hardware

- iPad Pro (9.7-inch) <small>that I rarely use nowadays</small>

### Mac

My daily driver.

- MacBook Pro 13-inch (Mac14,7)
- Apple M2 processor
- 16GB of memory
- macOS 26 (Tahoe)

### Linux

I am reconnecting with Linux on a second laptop after years of being away from Linux. While running [Linux on a T2 Mac](https://wiki.t2linux.org) is not perfect, it is good to get reacquainted with Linux and tell me if I should consider moving to something like a [Framework](https://frame.work) laptop whenever I replace my current daily driver.

- MacBook Pro 15-inch (MacBookPro15,1)
- Intel Core i9-9980HK processor
- 32GB of memory
- AMD Radeon Pro 560X
- EndeavourOS with Hyprland

### Windows

For gaming. I'm likely going to move it to Linux soon; Windows 10 reached end-of-life, Windows 11 looks like a mess and does not support my processor 🙃, and gaming on Linux is good for the games I currently to play.

- NZXT S340 ATX Mid Tower
- Intel Core i5-6600K processor
- 16GB of memory
- Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070
- Windows 10

These are my essentials when sitting on a fixed desk:

- Dell U2715H 27" 1440p monitor
- Apple Magic Trackpad (for everything besides gaming)
- Logitech G305 Mouse (for gaming)
- A mechanical keyboard from the list below
- AirPods Pro (1st gen)
- Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones
