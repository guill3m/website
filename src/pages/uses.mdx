- MacBook Pro 13-inch (Mac14,7)
- Apple M2 processor
- 16GB of memory
- macOS Sequoia

### Linux

I am currently reconnecting with Linux on a secondary laptop after years of being away from Linux. Running [Linux on a T2 Mac](https://wiki.t2linux.org) is not perfect, but it is good to get reacquainted with Linux and tell me if I should consider moving to something like a [Framework](https://frame.work) laptop whenever I replace my current daily driver.

- MacBook Pro 15-inch (MacBookPro15,1)
- Intel Core i9-9980HK processor
- 32GB of memory
- AMD Radeon Pro 560X
- EndeavourOS with Hyprland

### Windows

For gaming. I'm considering moving it to Linux at some point; Windows 10 is aproaching end-of-life, Windows 11 looks like a mess and does not support my processor ðŸ™ƒ, and gaming on Linux is good for the games I want to play anyways.

- NZXT S340 ATX Mid Tower
- Intel Core i5-6600K processor
- 16GB of memory
- Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070
- Windows 10
