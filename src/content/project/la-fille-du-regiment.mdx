During my studies at [EASD València](https://www.easdvalencia.com) I had the opportunity to learn from renewed valencian designers in various workshops. In this case it was a three day workshop with [Ibán Ramón](https://www.ibanramon.com), during which we designed, in teams of four, a poster for the opera “La Fille du Régiment”.

This opera was interpreted by students of [ESAD València](https://esadvalencia.com) and the posters made in this workshop were used to promote it.
