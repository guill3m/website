During my six and a half years working at [Ada Health](https://ada.com), I worked on the company website (a mix of corporate site, user acquisition channel, and product site), the first year as a Web Developer and after as Team Lead. Over the years, my role and team at Ada constantly evolved. From working with and managing a multi-disciplinary team in Marketing to a hands-on Engineering Manager in a product-focused team:

- Expanded the site from 2 to 6 languages, boasting over 2.500 pages in total and going from ~10.000 visitors monthly to consistently over 1 million organic visitors per month, driving hundreds of app installs daily.
- Spearheaded the transformation of Ada’s website, overseeing a complete redesign, CMS overhaul, and framework migration that boosted end-user performance, efficiency, and usability.
- Facilitated cross-functional collaboration, aligning with stakeholders on tech initiatives and roadmap, driving organisational priorities, and ensuring team execution on high-impact projects.
- Led the recruitment and managed developers, designers, and SEO managers. Strengthening the team’s ability to consistently deliver results aligned with business priorities.
- Guided the team through multiple business changes and strategic pivots. Providing mentorship, resources, and support to foster individual growth and team success.

_<small>**Note:** I worked on the engineering side of this site, my direct involvement in the visual design of it was limited to small contributions. In my role as Team Lead of the team I provided general guidance to the designers I managed.</small>_
