# www.GuillemAndreu.com

My personal site. Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

## What is this project?

This site is as much an experimentation tool as it is a way to have some fully-owned web presence. It is never considered finished or complete.

[See more on the colophon.](https://www.guillemandreu.com/colophon/)

## Previous iterations

Previous iterations of the site include:

- fully static "by-hand" HTML builds,
- using PHP for templating,
- a [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) theme,
- built with [Ghost](https://ghost.org),
- as a static site built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com),
- a, mostly static, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) site
- and many more that I can't remember anymore.

Some of these iterations live here on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/guill3m?tab=repositories), some are from before I even knew what Git was so they only live in some dusty hard drive.
