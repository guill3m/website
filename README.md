My personal site. Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

## What is this project?

This site is as much an experimentation tool as it is a way to have some fully-owned web presence. It is never considered finished or complete.

The way some details on the site are built might seem overkill at times. That's by design, I probably wanted to test or play with a different tech or approach at the time, “the right tool for the job” in this project is not so much what is better for the project by what is better for me at the time, to learn more.

~~## Why Next.js for this project?~~

~~I'm most familiar with React in terms of reactivity on the web and a framework like Next.js gives me a solid base to experiment on.~~

## Why Astro for this project?

Lately, I have grown more and more interested in the concept of [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) and how this site (until now essentially static and far from interesting) could evolve in that direction. The rewrite in Astro is the first step.

After having used Astro in another project, it became clear that for a content-driven site, like this one aims to be, Astro would be an excellent choice, both on the developer experience and end-user performance.

Additionally, the [Islands Architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) concept really resonated with me and how I believe sites with little need for reactivity should be built. It reminds me of the approach I took when integrating Vue into a “legacy” frontend application for the first time years ago and I still stand by, start by adding semi-isolated bits of reactivity/interactivity where needed instead of rewriting the entire thing.

## Previous iterations

Previous iterations of the site include:

- fully static "by-hand" HTML builds,
- using PHP for templating,
- a [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) theme,
- built with [Ghost](https://ghost.org),
- as a static site built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com),
- a, mostly static, Next.js site
- and many more that I can't remember anymore.

Some of these iterations live here on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/guill3m?tab=repositories), some are from before I even knew what Git was so they only live in some dusty hard drive.
