[Fournier](https://www.nhfournier.es/en/) is a well known Spanish playing card manufacturer, one of the most important in the world. In 2008, to celebrate their 140th anniversary, they organised a 40 cards Spanish deck design contest.

This is my submission for the aformentioned contest, in which I finalised in 6th position.
